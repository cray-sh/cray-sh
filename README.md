- Hi, I’m Adam Palenchar (cray-sh).
- I'm a graduate in physics with a love of both programming and science.
- I recently picked up a certificate on python automation.
- I'm making a bit of a career change embracing the analytical mindset that comes with science (and physics) and joining it with the infinite puzzles that come with programming.
- Passion drives me to learn and challenge myself on a daily basis.
- I’m interested in python programming and data science.
- I’m currently learning SQL, Git, Cloud based services, Power BI, and continuing to strengthen my python.
- Have a good day if you've come this far and read this :)
